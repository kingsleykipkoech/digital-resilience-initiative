            <p>Welcome! This portfolio documents my venture creation journey aimed at solving the systemic cybersecurity vulnerability faced by small businesses and non-profits (SBNPOs) in developing regions like Nairobi, Kenya.</p>

            <h2>The Entrepreneurial Journey: Problem Validation</h2>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>SBNPOs face continuous risk because they lack the technical expertise and financial resources to secure their digital infrastructure. Our research validated this problem stems from a **Systemic Awareness Deficit** and **Insurmountable Resource Barriers**.</p>
            
            <h3>Validated Data (Pain Points)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Intention-Capacity Gap:** 66.7% of leaders rank security as high priority, but are blocked by structural issues (Survey Q1).</li>
                <li>**High Cost Barrier:** The cost of commercial antivirus software is prohibitively expensive for tight budgets, making security an immediate low priority (Secondary Research).</li>
                <li>**Misperception of Risk:** Leaders mistakenly believe, "We are too small to be a target," ensuring urgent investment is neglected (Interview Theme).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Solution: The Open-Source Imperative</h2>
            <p>The solution is an **Accessible, Open-Source Security Platform** coupled with **Integrated Digital Literacy Training** (Contextual Security Training).</p>

            <h3>Key Features & Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Zero Cost Barrier:** Open-source model eliminates licensing fees (addressing the 40% cost barrier).</li>
                <li>**Simplicity & Usability:** Designed to be **invisible to the end-user** and require **minimal technical capacity** (addressing the 40% expertise barrier).</li>
                <li>**Context-Aware Training:** Security education integrated directly into the tool (e.g., a pop-up explains why a file is dangerous right when a user attempts to click it).</li>
                <li>**Implementation:** Delivery through **Local IT Consulting Firms/Vendors** (the validated trusted source).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="usp">**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** The only free, simplified security platform that integrates essential, context-specific digital literacy training for SBNPOs.</p>

            <h2>Prototype & Milestones</h2>
            <p>The Low-Fidelity Prototype (LFP) focuses on a minimalist, user-friendly dashboard.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Prototype Drawing (LFP)</h3>

                <figcaption>Initial Sketch of the "Resilience Dashboard" - Focus: Green/Red status, one-click fixes.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Key Adaptations</h3>
            <p>Adaptation based on user feedback included shifting focus from complex log reports to a simple **Green/Red Status Light** visible on the taskbar, and prioritizing **automated, background updates** to reduce staff time commitment.</p>

            <h2>Reflection & Lessons Learned</h2>
            <h3>Challenges & Lessons</h3>
            <p>The primary challenge was overcoming the initial assumption that the problem was solely a lack of awareness. Research proved the issue is a structural financial constraint. The lesson learned is that solutions must be designed for **zero financial barrier** and **minimal behavioral change**.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Our current prototype validates the potential for an effective open-source solution. The next steps involve developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and designing the Lean Canvas model to ensure financial sustainability through grants and premium support services.</p>
